# **Obesity Risk Classification with Deep Learning**

- Obesity has become a global health challenge, with rising cases contributing to various chronic illnesses and reduced quality of life. Understanding and classifying obesity categories based on lifestyle and demographic data can provide crucial insights into addressing this epidemic. In this project, we leverage the power of **deep learning** to build an efficient classification system for predicting obesity categories.

- Using data provided in the `Playground Series - Season 4, Episode 2` competition on Kaggle, we preprocess and transform the dataset to uncover meaningful patterns. By combining advanced techniques such as **data visualization**, **model optimization**, and **deep learning architectures**, our aim is to achieve a robust and interpretable solution for multi-class obesity classification.

## **Project Goals**

The objectives of this project include:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize data distributions and correlations to identify key factors influencing obesity categories.
- **Model Development**: Develop a multi-class classification model using a deep learning neural network, optimized for accuracy and interpretability.
- **Evaluation and Validation**: Assess model performance using appropriate evaluation metrics such as **accuracy**, **classification reports**, and **confusion matrices**.
- **Submission to Kaggle**: Generate predictions for the test dataset and prepare a well-formatted `submission.csv` file for competition evaluation.
- **Insights and Impact**: Provide actionable insights derived from the modelâ€™s predictions, supporting data-driven decision-making in healthcare.
